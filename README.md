# abflow
ABFlow is a webâ€‘based priority management tool that helps you organize, schedule and track your tasks using the ABCDE method. Inspired by Trello, it was built with React on the frontend, Firebase for authentication and MongoDB for data storage.

The application has been deployed live using [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) for the frontend and [Render](https://render.com/) for the backend.<br>
Currently live deployed at: https://abflow.netlify.app
## Dependencies

To install all dependencies, run the following command on the `frontend`, `backend` and `root` folders:

```
npm install
```
